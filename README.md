## 🏆 Real-World AI Project Highlights

These projects demonstrate my end-to-end expertise in designing, building, and deploying AI solutions that drive efficiency and security.

### 1. Enterprise Service Desk Automation Bot (Office Project)
* **Goal:** Designed and deployed an AI-powered ticketing bot to automate request creation, categorization, and assignment, reducing manual overhead and accelerating resolution times.
* **Skills Demonstrated:** **Copilot Studio** (Frontend Agent), **Power Automate** (Workflow Orchestration), **Freshdesk/Freshservice API** Integration, LLM Integration (OpenAI/Azure AI), Workflow Design.
* **Impact:** [Quantify the impact if possible: e.g., *Reduced Tier-1 ticket resolution time by 30%.*]

### 2. Multi-Source RAG for Sales Intelligence (Office Project)
* **Goal:** Built a specialized RAG system enabling sales teams to ask complex questions over client data aggregated from structured Excel metadata and corresponding unstructured, linked documents (Case Studies, SOWs).
* **Skills Demonstrated:** **Qdrant** (Vector Database), **Custom RAG Pipeline** (Document Loading & Splitting), **Multimodal Embedding** (Excel Text + Linked Documents), Advanced Metadata Handling, Python.
* **Unique Feature:** **Embedded data from structured Excel rows and their corresponding URLs/documents simultaneously** for comprehensive answers.

### 3. Stealth Agent: Vulnerability Assessment and Remediation (Group Contribution)
* **Goal:** Developed a security agent that analyzes application vulnerabilities and provides specific, actionable remediation steps by reasoning over multiple security reports.
* **My Contribution Focus:** **Data Engineering for Security RAG.** Generated standardized JSON reports from SAST (Static Analysis), SCA (Supply Chain), and DAST (Dynamic Analysis) tools; developed the **Custom RAG pipeline** for embedding this structured/unstructured security data into a vector store; and designed the retrieval mechanism for problem localization and suggested fixes.
* **Skills Demonstrated:** **Custom RAG**, Chunking Strategies, Security Tool Integration (SAST/DAST/SCA), Vector Data Preparation, LlamaIndex/LangChain orchestration.
